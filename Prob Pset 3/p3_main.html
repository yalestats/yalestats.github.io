    <h1>Problem 3: Normal Distributions cont.</h1>
    <div>
		<p>Suppose you want to ensure that the probability of running out of stock is 1 percent or less. How many units should you stock?</p>
		<p>Recall that demand is normally distributed with mean 200 and standard deviation 15.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">I don't know where to start</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">235</button>
		<button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">245</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph4')">165</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden">This problem essentially asks you to invert the calculations that we have been doing in the previous problems (if you have not done these or struggled with understanding them, consider <a href=p1_main.html>working through them slowly for practice</a>). Instead of taking a number of units and getting a probability, we have a probability and want to compute a number of units. How can we use our standard normal to do this? Whatâ€™s the correct number to look up in the table? (If you are finding it difficult to find the correct number in the table, note that the numbers in the normal probability table are invariably in increasing order.)</p>
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden">Correct! If we use a standard normal table to look up what value of z ensures that 99 percent of the area under the curve lies to the left of z, we will find the answer is about 2.33 standard deviations. Converting from a standard normal to our normal of interest yields 235.</p>
	<p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you probably relied on a heuristic such as the 99.7 percent rule to guess that 3 standard deviations above the mean would be sufficient. For this problem, you should calculate the precise number of units that are required.</p>
    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you probably looked up the wrong number in the probability table, likely because you forgot that the probability table gives the probability for the area <b>to the left</b> of the cutoff. Here, we want to make sure that the area <b>to the right</b> contains less than 1 percent of the probability. This answer also does not pass a smell test (which you should always perform before committing to a quantitative result). If you want a low probability of running out of stock, your stock must <b>at least</b> be above the mean of demand.</p>
