    <h1>Sub-Problem: Means and Variance of Random Variables cont.</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Suppose you have the same random variable X. Recall that it takes the value of 1 with probability 50%, 2 with probability 25%, and 4 with probability 25%. This generated a mean of 2 and a variance of 1.5.</p>
		
        <p>Suppose now that we define a random variable Y so that Y is generated by taking a draw of X, <b>multiplying</b> the draw by 5, and using the result as our draw for Y.</p>	

		<p>What is the expected value of Y? What is the variance?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">10, 37.5</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">10, 1.5</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">10, 7.5</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden">Correct!</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you probably tried to “shortcut” the answer by applying the same reasoning as the previous section and multiplying the expected value by 5 while leaving the variance unchanged. You need to compute the variance!</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you probably tried to “shortcut” the answer by multiplying both the expected value and variance by 5. You need to compute the variance!</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div>
        <p>Recall that the variance of X is 1.5, so it has a standard deviation of √1.5. What is that standard deviation of Y?</p>

        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph6')">√1.5 </button>

    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden">Correct!</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph5" class="hidden">Incorrect.</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph6" class="hidden">Incorrect.</p>

	<div id="explanation" class="hidden">
		<p>Like in the case when we added 2, the fact that the expected value of Y is 5 times the expected value of X is not a coincidence. This will hold for any number! Unlike when we added, however, note that the variance (and thus standard deviation) have changed. The variance has been multiplied by 25 (5 squared, not a coincidence) and the standard deviation has been multiplied by 5. Like in the case of addition, these are general rules that would have applied no matter what number we multiplied by.</p>
		<p>Why does multiplication change the variance while addition does not? Think about what is happening to the “spread” of numbers when we multiply. Before we multiplied, the most extreme values of 1 and 4 were reasonably close. After we multiply these become 5 and 20 respectively, which are much further apart. Thus the variance increases. This is sometimes why the a multiplication factor of a distribution is called the “spread” parameter.</p>
