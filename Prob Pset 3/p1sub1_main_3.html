    <h1>Sub-Problem: Means and Variance of Random Variables cont.</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Suppose I have a random variable X that has a standard normal distribution (i.e. normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0). </p>
		
        <p>Given what we’ve learned about how means and variances interacted with addition and multiplication, what do you think the distribution of a random variable Y created by first multiplying X by 6 and then adding 15 would be?</p>	
    </div>
    
    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">Normal with mean 15 and standard deviation 6</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">Normal with mean 15 and standard deviation 1</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">Normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 6</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden">Correct!</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden">Incorrect. Review the rules we’ve established for how standard deviations change when multiplied.</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">Incorrect. Review the rules we’ve established for how means change when constants are added.</p>
	<br>

        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('explanation')">Show Explanation</button>
    </div>
	
	<div id="explanation" class="hidden">
		<p>Note that while we’ve (hopefully) built a lot of intuition for how means and standard deviations move under constant multiplication and addition, we’ve left out one small detail which is that a normal distribution remains normal under these transformations. For the purposes of this course, it is sufficient to simply know that this is true without worrying about why.</p>
		<p>Here we see how to use our rules to convert a standard normal distribution into <b>any</b> normal distribution we like, as long as we know the mean and variance. We can do the reverse as well. By <b>subtracting</b> by the correct number and <b>dividing</b> by the correct number, we can convert any normal distribution into a standard normal (which can then be looked up in our standard normal table). This is the approach we must take when solving problems involving probabilities of normal distributions!</p>
