    <h1>Problem 1: Drawing Balls from a Bag</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Suppose we have a bag containing ten balls. The balls can be blue or red and can be marked with a dot or unmarked. 
		Two of the balls are blue and unmarked, four of the balls are red and unmarked, two of the balls are blue and marked, 
		and two of the balls are red and marked.</p>
		
        <p>Assuming we are equally likely to draw each ball, if we draw a single ball, what is the probability that it is blue or is marked (or both)?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">I don't know where to start</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">6/10</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">8/10</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph4')">2/10</button>
		<button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph5')">4/10</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden">Because each ball is equally likely to be drawn and there are ten balls, 
	we known that each ball has a 1/10 chance of being drawn. Using this, we can find the probability of drawing 
	a blue ball by counting the number of ball balls in the bag (four) and multiplying to find that 4/10 is the probability 
	of drawing a blue ball. We can use this same technique to find the probability of other types of balls.</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden">Correct! Out of the ten balls that we could draw from, 6 satisfy our criteria of being blue or marked.</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you likely double-counted the balls that are blue and marked. 
	There are 4 blue balls so the probability of drawing a blue ball is 4/10. There are also 4 marked balls so the probability of 
	drawing a marked ball is 4/10. However, because two of the blue balls are also marked, the total number of blue or marked balls is 
	only 6 (2 blue unmarked + 2 blue marked + 2 red marked). Thus the total number of balls satisfying the requirement is 6, not 8. This 
	is the reasoning behind the formula P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) â€“ P(A AND B).</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you likely only counted 
	the balls that are both blue and marked. Because we are looking for balls that are blue OR marked, 
	the blue unmarked balls (2) and the red marked balls (2) both satisfy the requirement along with 
	the blue marked balls (2), making 6 total balls. </p>
	
	<p id="paragraph5" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you likely forgot to count the balls that were both blue and marked.</p>
