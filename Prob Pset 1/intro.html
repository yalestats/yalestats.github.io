    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Many things in the world are uncertain. If I flip a typical coin, it is unknown (at least at the time of the toss) 
		whether it will land on heads or tails. As a more complex example, if the Lakers and the Nets (two basketball teams in the NBA) 
		are playing against each other tonight, it is unknown who will win. <b>Probability</b> gives us a coherent and well-defined way to talk 
		about these uncertain outcomes.</p>
		
        <p>The simplest type of event are those in which all outcomes are equally likely to occur. Examples include rolling a 
		six-sided die (each number 1 through 6 is equally likely to occur) or drawing from a well-shuffled deck of cards 
		(each of the 52 cards has a 1 out of 52 chance of being drawn).</p>
		
        <p>Starting from this building block, we will do some sample problems to build intuition for how the probability of different events can be combined.</p>
