    <h1>Problem 3: Rain, Temperature, and Umbrellas</h1>
    <div>
        <p>We are trying to decide if we should bring an umbrella with us on our way to class. From experience living in New Haven, we have an idea of the chance of rain based on the temperature during the midday. </p>
		
        <p>There is a 40 percent chance that the midday temperature will be below 65 degrees and a 60 percent chance that it will be above 65 degrees. If the temperature is below 65 degrees, we think that there is a 50 percent chance that it will rain. If it is above, we think that there is a 25 percent chance it will rain.</p>
		
		<p>What is the probability that both of these statements are true: a) the midday temperature is below 65 degrees and b) it does not rain?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">I don't know where to start</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">20 percent</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">40 percent</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph4')">50 percent</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden">This is a case where we are interested in the probability of two events, one of which follows the other. First, we observe the temperature, then, we observe the rain. We need to compute that the temperature is below 65 degrees AND it does not rain. If you are struggling to remember or understand how these AND probabilities are compute, consider <a href="p1_main.html">returning to Problems 1 and 2</a> which consider this same question in a more intuitive context.</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden">Correct! Drawing the probability tree, it's clear that the probability we are seeking can be computing by multiplying 40% by 50%</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you correctly found the probability that the temperature is below 65, but forgot to account for the probability that it rains. That is, you forgot the P(B|A) term in P(A AND B)=P(A)*P(B|A)</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you correctly found the probability that it rains, conditional on a low temperature, but forgot to account for the first probability that the temperature ends up being below 65 degree.. That is, you forgot the P(A) term in P(A AND B)=P(A)*P(B|A).</p>
