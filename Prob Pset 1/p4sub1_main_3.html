    <h1>Sub-Problem: Conditional Probability, Intuitively (cont)</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Out of our 20 balls, we've determined that 4 should be blue and marked, 4 should be blue and unmarked, 3 should be red and marked, and 9 should be red and unmarked</p>	

		<p>If you draw a ball at random, what is the probability that you draw a marked ball?</p>

		<p>In finding the probability of drawing a marked ball, we've essentially found the probability of rain from the previous problem! What steps did we follow to do this?</p>
		<p>First, we found the probability of every outcome. We started with the unconditional probabilities we were given (whether it was a warm and cold day) and used the formula P(A AND B)=P(A)P(B|A) to find the probability of every event. For example, we wanted to find the probability P(cold AND rain), and we did so using P(cold AND rain)=P(cold)P(rain|cold). We did the same for all combination of cold/hot and rain/no rain. We did all of this implicitly when we calculated what combination of blue/red and marked/unmarked our 20 balls should be.</p>
		<p>Second, we determined which of the four outcomes met the conditions we want ("Is it raining") and used the formula P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A AND B). In this case, event A was "it is a cold day and it rains" and event B was "it is a warm day and it rains". Note that P(A AND B) = 0 because it cannot be both a warm and cold day.</p>
