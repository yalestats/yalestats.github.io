    <h1>Problem 2: Drawing Balls from a Bag cont.</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Suppose we have a bag containing ten balls. The balls can be blue or red and can be marked with a dot or unmarked. 
		Two of the balls are blue and unmarked, four of the balls are red and unmarked, two of the balls are blue and marked, 
		and two of the balls are red and marked.</p>
		
        <p>If we first draw one red ball and do not put it back, what is the probability that the next ball we draw from the remaining balls is also red?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">I don't know where to start</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">1/3</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">9/25</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph4')">3/10</button>
		<button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph5')">1/2</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden">The key to this problem is to note that these are consecutive events. 
	We should keep track of the number of red balls in the bag for each draw, as well as the total number of balls in the bag.</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden">Correct!</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you likely forgot to account for the fact that the probability of 
	the second draw depends on the outcome of the first. If we draw one of the six red balls in our first draw (6/10 chance), 
	there are five red balls remaining in the bag and nine balls total. Thus the probability of drawing the second red ball is NOT 
	another 6/10. This is the reason that the formula P(A AND B) = P(A)*P(B|A) is true, rather than the perhaps more intuitive but incorrect P(A AND B) = P(A)*P(B).</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you likely forgot to account for the fact that drawing a red ball on the first draw reduces the number of red balls in the bag (from 6 to 5) but ALSO reduces the total number of balls in the bag (from 10 to 9). Thus the probability of drawing a second red ball is not 5/10.</p>
	
	<p id="paragraph5" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you likely forgot to account for the fact that drawing the first red ball reduces the number of red balls in the bag (from 6 to 5). Thus the probability of drawing the second red ball is not 6/9.</p>
