    <h1>Sub-Problem: Conditional Probability, Intuitively</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Let’s translate the previous question into something more familiar, the bag of colored balls. Let’s say that a blue ball represents an outcome where the temperature is below 65 degrees while a red ball represents an outcome where the temperature is above 65 degrees. Similarly, if a ball is marked with a dot, it represents an outcome where it rains while an unmarked ball represents no rain.</p>
		
        <p>In the previous question, we said that there was a 40 percent chance that the temperature was below 65 degrees (and a 60 percent chance that it was above). If we have 20 balls in our bag, how many should be blue and how many should be red to represent this probability?</p>		
    </div>
    
    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">8 blue and 12 red</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">8 blue and 8 red</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">12 blue and 8 red</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph4')">12 blue and 12 red</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden">Correct!</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden">Incorrect: We assumed that there are 20 balls in the bag. If 8 are red, what is the chance that we draw a red ball? How does this compare to the probability of a warm day?</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you likely flipped the colors of the balls on accident</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden">Incorrect: We assumed that there are 20 balls in the bag. If 12 are blue, what is the chance that we draw a blue ball? How does this compare to the probability of a cold day?</p>
