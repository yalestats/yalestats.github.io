    <h1>Sub-Problem: Conditional Probability, Intuitively (cont)</h1>
    <div>
        <p>We just decided that out of 20 balls, 8 should be blue (to represent a 40 percent chance of a cold day) and 12 should be red (to represent a 60 percent chance of a warm day).</p>
		
        <p>In the previous question, we said that if it was a cold day, there was a 50 percent chance it would rain and if it was a warm day, the chance was 50 percent.</p>

		<p>If marked balls represent days where it rains, how many blue balls should be marked to represent these probabilities? How many red balls should be marked?</p>		
    </div>
    
    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">4 blue and 3 red</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">4 blue and 6 red</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">2 blue and 6 red</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph4')">2 blue and 3 red</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden">Correct!</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you probably applied the probability of rain on cold days to the red balls. Remember that the probability of rain depends on whether it is a cold of warm day, thus different proportions of the blue and red balls should be marked.</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you likely flipped the colors of the balls on accident</p>
	
    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you probably applied the probability of rain on warm days to the blue balls. Remember that the probability of rain depends on whether it is a cold of warm day, thus different proportions of the blue and red balls should be marked.</p>
