    <h1>Problem 5: Probability Calculations and Expected Values cont.</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Adrian is listening to music on a playlist that he likes but does not love. Every time he finishes a song, there is a 15 percent chance that he will stop listening before the next song plays (he will listen to the first song for sure). After 5 songs, he will stop listening with certainty.</p>
		<p>Suppose Adrian tells you that he listened to at least 2 songs. What is now your expected value for the number of songs that he listened to?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">I don't know where to start</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">4.19</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">3.56</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph4')">3.70</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden">This problem, while it asks you to compute an expected value, smells a lot like a conditional probability problem. Revisiting the formula for expected value and look at what probabilities are involved. Can you recompute those probabilities given the new information we have? Recall the conditional probability formula and remember to use the probability rule for complements! (P(A) = 1 – P(not A))</p>
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden">Correct!</p>
    <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you probably forgot to renormalize your conditional probabilities by the probabilities that Adrian listens to 2 or more songs. One intuitive to see this and “catch the error before it happens” is to note that this answer is <b>less</b> than the correct answer from the last question on expected value (which was 3.70). How could our expected value go down once we are given information that Adrian listened to a *minimum* number of songs?</p>
    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you applied the expected value formula without accounting for the new information we’ve been given, namely that Adrian listened to at least 2 songs. How does this change our computation of the probabilities?</p>
