    <h1>Sub Problem: Conditional Probability</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Using the probability tree from the previous page (<a href=p2sub1_main_3.html>click here</a> to go back if you didn't draw it): If it rains, what is the expected number of minutes it will take you to get to work?</p>
		<p>One approach to this problem would be to follow the same approach as the last problem and compute the conditional expectations directly using the conditional probability formula. However, in this situation, we can exploit the intuition that conditional expectations and probabilities involve “stepping into” the probability tree.</p>
		<p>We are told that it rains. Therefore, we can “step forward” into our probability tree and head down the first fork (which is whether it rains or not) towards the direction of rain. We can then use probabilities from this “inner tree” to compute our conditional expectation!</p>
		<p>Using this approach, what is the answer to the question above?</p>

        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">24 minutes</button>

        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">22 minutes</button>

        <p>Depending on the situation, one of these two different approaches may be easiest/most useful. Try to make sure you are able to use both!</p>
