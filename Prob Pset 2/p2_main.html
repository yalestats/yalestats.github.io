    <h1>Problem 2: Expected Values cont.</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Suppose you are told that you will be meeting with Negotiator A. Now what is your expected payment?</p>
		<p>Recall that you think there is a 25 percent chance they will accept your offer of $10 million, a 40 percent chance they will counteroffer $15 million which you will accept, and a 35 percent chance that they will counteroffer something higher which you will deny (and spend $0 million in this transaction).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">I don't know where to start</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">$8.5 million</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">$15 million</button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph4')">$8.3 million</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden">This problem asks you to compute a conditional expectation. In this case, it is the expected value of the transaction <b>given</b> that you meet with Negotiator A. A conditional expectation calculation looks a lot like a normal expectation calculation, but with the probabilities replaced with conditional probabilities. If you are having trouble, consider doing <a href=p2sub1_main.html>this</a> sub-problem to build intuition for conditional probabilities.</p>
    <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden">Correct!</p>
    <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">Incorrect. Recall that the expected value is <b>not</b> the same as the "most likely" value.</p>
    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden">If you arrived at this answer, you probably took the simple average of the possible outcomes. Remember that expected value calculations need to incorporate the probability that outcomes occur!</p>
