    <h1>Topic 4: The p-value</h1>
    <div>
        <p>In the last section, we talked about how the Central Limit Theorem allows us 
            to treat the t-statistic as if it follows a normal distribution. 
            Now we're going to build on that and discuss p-values, a fundamental concept in hypothesis testing.</p>
            
            <!--In the previous section, we used the Central Limit Theorem to show that the t-statistic is approximately normal distributed when 
            <span class="mathjax">\(N>30\)</span>. Now we'll use this fact to construct p-values, an important building block of hypothesis testing.
            So what is the p-value? -->

            
            <p>So what's a p-value? Simply put, 
                it's <b>the likelihood of getting a test statistic 
                (like the t-statistic) that is as extreme or more extreme than what you've observed, 
                assuming that your baseline theory (null hypothesis) is true.</b>
                <!--<b>A p-value is the probability of obtaining a 
                test statistic at least as extreme as the one you calculated under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.</b>--> </p> 
                <h3>Practice Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine that you're the car manufacturer from the previous page deciding whether you should begin offering a new line of electric trucks.
                    Suppose you survey 30 consumers about their willingness to pay (WTP) for electric trucks and collect the following data:

                    <div class="centered-figure">
                        <figure>
                            <img src="figures/survey_fig.png" alt="crit_image">
                          </figure>
                        </div>
                    </p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    As before, you will develop the new product line if average consumer WTP <span class="mathjax">\(\ \mu \)</span> is greater than <span class="mathjax">\(\$55,000\)</span>. On the previous page,
                    we showed that the correct null and alternative hypotheses for this setting are <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu \le $55,000\)</span>
                    and <span class="mathjax">\(H_1: \mu > $55,000\)</span>. 
                    
                    <p>
                        1. Using the survey summary statistics and hypotheses above, what 
                        is the correct t-statistic for this problem?
                    </p>
                </p>

                <div class="button-container">

                            statistic <span class="mathjax">\(\hat{t} \)</span> is the p-value.
                            This is illustrated for the 3 different kinds of hypothesis tests (left, right, two-sided) below. The p-value measures the probability 
                            of collecting an average WTP estimate at least as extreme as the one we calculated in our survey if the null hypothesis <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu \le $55,000\)</span> is true.

                Because the t-statistic is approximately normally distributed, we know that
                <span class="mathjax">$$\Pr(t \le \hat{t}) = \Phi(\hat{t})$$</span> where <span class="mathjax">\(\Phi(\cdot)\)</span>

                and find p-values.

            </p>

            <p>
            One last thing: remember that the formula for the t-statistic is

            is the true mean under the assumption that the null hypothesis <span class="mathjax">\(H_0\)</span> is true. In fact, we <b>cannot</b> calculate a test statistic and perform a hypothesis test 
            unless the null hypothesis is assumed to be true.

   <!--     <h3>Practice Problem</h3>

            <b>Note:</b> This practice problem asks you to use R to perform a simulation. For reproducibility, you should use <i>set.seed(123)</i>
 to set a value for the random seed before beginning. <b>If you are confused, try asking ChatGPT before clicking the help button.</b>

            
        <p> A car manufacturer is deciding whether they should begin offering a new line of electric trucks. They decide that they will offer these new vehicles 
            as long as market research suggests that consumers are willing to offer more than <span class="mathjax">\($55,000\)</span> for the trucks. 
            The manufacturer's marketing team designs a survey to elicit willingness to pay from a set of representative consumers. Suppose that true willingness to pay is
            approximately normally distributed with mean <span class="mathjax">\(\mu = $52,000\)</span> and standard deviation  <span class="mathjax">\(\sigma = $9,000\)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                1.  <a href="https://rdrr.io/snippets/">Using R</a>, construct a random sample of willingness to pay for 30 consumers. 
                Calculate the test statistic and p-value for the difference between these consumers' average willingness to pay and <span class="mathjax">\(\mu = $55,000\)</span>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Construct a vector of 30 consumers with willingness to pay equal to exactly $55,000.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Now take these two sets of 30 consumer measures of willingness to pay (WTP) and randomly divide them into 2 groups of 30. 
                Calculate the test statistic for the difference in mean WTP between these two groups of 100. 
                Repeat this process 500 times. 
                <b>What does this accomplish?</b> You are simulating test statistics for the case when the 
                difference in average WTP between the surveyed consumers and $55,000 is only due to chance. Equivalently, 
                these simulated test statistics are calculated under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. 
            </p>
            <p>
            4. Finally, calculate the share of iterations (i.e. <span class="mathjax">\(\frac{\#}{500}\)</span> ) where the value of the test statistic 
            is greater than the test statistic in the original dataset of 100 salaries. 
            This proportion is a simulated p-value. Compare this result with the p-value from the original sample. Are they approximately the same?

    <p id="paragraph0" class="hidden"> First, draw 100 normally 
        distributed random variables at once using the <i>rnorm()</i> command. In the same loop iteration, take the average of these 100 random variables and construct 
        a t-statistic using the formula provided in the previous conceptual section (<b>hint:</b> when the null hypothesis is true, <span class="mathjax">\(\mu = 55,000\)</span>). 
        Next, use the <i>c()</i> command to create a vector representing 100 consumers with WTP = $55,000. Then use the <i>rbind()</i> to combine 
        these two vectors. Next, you should implement a <b>for</b> loop in R. In each step, use the <i>sample()</i> command to split the vector into two random groups. If
    you have trouble implementing this method, don't worry - ChatGPT is quite good at it!</p>

<p id="paragraph5" class="hidden"> The simulated p-value and sample p-value should be about the same. The reason is that the simulated p-value is the 
    simulated probability of observing an outcome at least as extreme as the one you got in the original sample conditional
