    <h1>Topic 3: Test Statistics</h1>
    <div>
        <p>In the previous section, we stated null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the population mean <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span>,
            but we rarely (if ever) observe <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span> in the real-world. Instead, we use sample 
            data to construct estimates of this unknown mean <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span>. We have already discussed that the 
            sample mean might be a reasonable guess for the population mean. Now let's connect this back to our discussion of hypothesis testing.
            </p> 

            <p>
            Since we never observe <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span>, it's not obvious how we should decide whether
            the sample data contains enough evidence in favor of <span class="mathjax">\(H_1\)</span> for us to reject <span class="mathjax">\(H_0\)</span>. 
            <b>Test statistics provide us with a systematic way of making this decision.</b>
            </p>

            <p> 
                Suppose you observe data on incomes of doctors with a mean of
                <span class="mathjax">\(\$350,000\)</span> and want to test whether doctors 
                typically make more than <span class="mathjax">\(\$300,000\)</span> or whether the doctors in your small sample were 
                just lucky. To do this, you might construct a test statistic. A test statistic is a function of the sample whose statistical distribution we can calculate.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most common test statistic is the t-statistic. The formula for the t-statistic for a sample average is given by 
                <span class="mathjax">$$t = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{N}} $$</span> where <span class="mathjax">\(\overline{X}\)</span> is 
                the sample average, <span class="mathjax">\(s\)</span> is the sample standard deviation, 
                <span class="mathjax">\(N\)</span> is the sample size, and <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span> is the population average 
                <b>under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true</b>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
You should be familiar with the t-statistic from course lectures. 
Because of the Central Limit Theorem, we know that the t-statistic is approximately normally distributed when <span class="mathjax">\(N>30\)</span>.
This <b>crucial</b> result allows us to use sample data generated from <i>any</i> unknown distribution to form a test statistic with a known distribution (standard normal). 
All we need are 3 basic sample statistics: the sample average, the sample standard deviation, and the sample size! 
        </p> 
     <!-- <p>
            Because we know the distribution of a standard normal random variable, 
            we are able to make statements about the probability of our sample estimate occurring if 
            the null hypothesis is true. What exactly does that mean? We can use an example to clear things up. 
        </p>

            <h3>Practice Problem</h3>

            <p><b>Note:</b> This practice problem asks you to use R to perform a simulation. For reproducibility, you should use  <span class="mathjax"> \( set.seed(123) \)</span>
                to set a value for the random seed before beginning. <b>If you are confused, try asking ChatGPT before clicking the help button.</b></p>
		
        <p> A car manufacturer is deciding whether they should begin offering a new line of electric trucks. They decide that they will offer these new vehicles 
            as long as market research suggests that the average consumer is willing to offer more than <span class="mathjax">\(\$55,000\)</span> for the trucks. 
            The manufacturer's marketing team designs a survey to elicit willingness to pay from a set of representative consumers. 
            The existing consensus is that willingness to pay is beneath <span class="mathjax">\(\$55,000\)</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Let <span class="mathjax">\(\mu \)</span></button> denote the average consumer willingness to pay. What are the correct null and alternative hypotheses? 
                </p>

                <div class="button-container">
                    <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph5')"><span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu \le \$55,000\)</span> and 
                        <span class="mathjax">\(H_1: \mu > \$55,000\)</span></button>
                </div>

                <div class="button-container">
                    <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph6')"><span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu \ge \$55,000\)</span> and 
                        <span class="mathjax">\(H_1: \mu < \$55,000\)</span></button>
                </div>

                <p id="paragraph5" class="hidden"> <b>This is correct!</b></p>

                    <p id="paragraph6" class="hidden"> <b>This is not correct.</b> Remember, the alternative hypothesis should 
                    reflect your new theory, not the previous view about consumer willingness to pay.</p>
            <p>

            Now suppose that true willingness to pay is approximately normally distributed 
            with mean <span class="mathjax">\(\mu = \$52,000\)</span> and standard deviation  <span class="mathjax">\(\sigma = \$9,000\)</span>. <a href="https://rdrr.io/snippets/">Using R</a>, 
            simulate a random sample of 100 consumers and construct a t-statistic <i>under the assumption the null hypothesis from (1) is true</i>. To 
            construct the t-statistic, follow the steps below:

            <p>
                i. Calculate the average willingness to pay <span class="mathjax">\(\overline{X} \)</span></button> among the 100 consumers 
                </p>

                <p>
                    ii. Calculate the standard deviation of willingness to pay <span class="mathjax">\(s \)</span></button> among the 100 consumers
                </p>
                <p>
                    iii. Use the provided formula along with these statistics and the value of <span class="mathjax">\(\mu \)</span></button> and <span class="mathjax">\(N \)</span></button> to form the t-statistic
                </p>

            2. Repeat this process 500 times and plot the distribution of t-statistics across all the iterations.
            </p>

    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph0')">I don't know where to start</button>
    </div>
    
    <p id="paragraph0" class="hidden"> Copy and paste the following prompt into ChatGPT: 
        <b>Consumer willingness to pay is normally distributed with mean $52,000 and standard deviation $9,000. 
            Provide me with R code that simulates a random sample of 100 consumers and constructs a t-statistic

            Repeat this process 500 times, generating 500 t-statistics. Then graph this distribution of 
            t-statistics as a histogram.

    You should have found that the t-statistic has a distribution that is approximately standard normal. In the next conceptual section, we will use this fact to develop
    some intuition about p-values. In this example, we know the values of the population parameters: in the real-world this is almost never the case. </p>
