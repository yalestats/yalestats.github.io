    <h1>Topic 2: Confidence Intervals</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Sample estimates of population parameters like the true average can be very 
            different across random samples from the same population. For example, with a fair die
            we might collect these two samples: <span class="mathjax"> \( \{1, 1, 1\} \)</span> and <span class="mathjax"> \( \{1, 6, 1, 3, 1, 1, 5, 4, 4, 6\} \)</span>.
            </p> 
            
            <p>The sample average in the first sample is 1, while the sample average in the 
            second sample is 3.2. We might use these samples to estimate the true average value (3.5) of a die roll.
        </p> 
        <p>
            <i>But given that different samples produce different estimates, how do we communicate the 
                uncertainty in our sample estimates of the true average?</i> 
            The most common way is by reporting something known as a <b>confidence interval</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A confidence interval is a random interval centered around a sample 
            estimate of a population parameter. Confidence intervals are constructed 
            in such a way that, if you keep regenerating the observed data from the 
            underlying true model, the confidence interval will contain the true parameter <span class="mathjax"> \( X\% \)</span> of 
            the time (often we care about 95% confidence intervals). 
            You learned a formula for a 95% confidence interval in lecture. For a population average <span class="mathjax"> \( \mu \)</span> of a normally distributed random variable, the 95% confidence interval is given by 
            <span class="mathjax">$$CI = [\overline{X}-1.96\times\frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}, \overline{X}+1.96\times\frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}]$$</span>
            where <span class="mathjax">\(\overline{X}\)</span> is the sample average, <span class="mathjax">\(s\)</span> is the sample standard deviation, 
            and <span class="mathjax">\(N\)</span> is the sample size. This formula calculates two numbers from the data: an <b>upper bound</b> and a <b>lower bound</b>. The idea is, 
            if we generate data from a normal distribution with unknown mean and keep repeating this process, 
            the upper and lower bound will contain the unknown mean 95% of the time.
        </p>

            <h3>Practice Problem</h3>

            <b>Note:</b> This practice problem asks you to use R to perform a simulation. For reproducibility, you should use  <span class="mathjax"> \( set.seed(123) \)</span>
                to set a value for the random seed before beginning. <b>If you are confused, try asking ChatGPT before clicking the help button.</b>
            
		
        <p> As before, suppose the earnings of adults in Nashville, Tennessee are approximately normally distributed with mean  <span class="mathjax"> \( \mu = 150,000 \)</span> and 
            standard deviation <span class="mathjax"> \( \sigma = 30,000 \)</span>. <a href="https://rdrr.io/snippets/">Use R</a> to construct a single sample containing 
            the earnings of 20 Nashville residents. Use this sample to 
            construct a 95% confidence interval for the population average earnings among Nashville adults as follows:

            <p>
                i. Calculate <span class="mathjax"> \( \overline{X} \)</span> - the average earnings among the 20 adults
            </p>
            <p>
                ii. Calculate <span class="mathjax"> \( s \)</span> - the standard deviation of earnings across the 20 adults
            </p>
            <p>
                iii. Calculate the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>What is the 95% confidence interval for average adult earnings in Nashville? </b>

  <!--  <h3>Practice Problem </h3>
		
    <p> Construct 95% confidence intervals for the true average for 100 different random samples of 1,000 adult residents of Nashville. 
        Construct another vector that lists the number of the random sample from 1-100. Then make a plot <a href="https://rdrr.io/snippets/">in R</a> containing the sample number 
        on the x-axis and the confidence interval for that sample on the y-axis. 
        Include a horizontal line for the true average of <span class="mathjax"> \( \mu = 150,000 \)</span>. How many of the confidence intervals contain <span class="mathjax"> \( \mu \)</span>?

<p id="paragraph4" class="hidden">You should implement a <b>for</b> loop in R. In each iteration of the loop, draw 1,000 normally 
    distributed random variables at once using the <i>rnorm()</i> command. In the same loop iteration, take the average of these 1,000 random variables and construct 
    a confidence interval using the formula from the previous practice problem. To make the resulting plot, you can use base R or the <i>ggplot</i> library. If 
you have trouble implementing this method, don't worry - ChatGPT is quite good at it!</p>

<p id="paragraph3" class="hidden">This problem should clarify that the confidence interval is a random interval constructed using a sample estimate of a population parameter
    that uses data from a single sample. For a 95% confidence interval, we have shown that 95% of these random intervals will contain a population parameter as the number of samples grows sufficiently large.</p>
