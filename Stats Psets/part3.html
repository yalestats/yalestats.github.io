    <h1>Question 1: Stating Hypotheses</h1>
    <div>
        <p>We often want to know the relationship between two population parameters. 
            Does an investment banking analyst make more on average than a software engineer? 
            Do new associates at top law firms bill 2000 hours annually? 
            </p> 
            
            <p>Even if we collect data on the salaries of every investment banking analyst and software engineer 
                or the billable hours of every legal associate, 
                we still do not observe the population parameters that we want to know about. 
                Why is this? Because every individualâ€™s salary or recorded billable hours is a random variable that 
                is drawn from an underlying <b>data generating process</b> (more on this in the previous conceptual pages). Ultimately, when we 
                ask about a population parameter we are asking about a feature of this underlying model.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The goal of any hypothesis test is to make an inference about these unknown 
            population parameter(s) using sample data. 
            Stating the right hypotheses can be tricky - we will walk through two examples below.
        </p>

            <h3>Practice Problem</h3>

            <p>
                <i>Note:</i> Let <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span> denote the population average billable hours for new legal associates.
                </p>
		
        <p>- You read that new legal associates at top law firms bill around 2000 hours annually. To test this, you manage to collect data on the billable hours 
            of new legal associates from all firms in the Vault 100. As a next step, you write out the null (<span class="mathjax">\(H_0\)</span>) and alternative (<span class="mathjax">\(H_1\)</span>) hypotheses
            for this research project. What are they?
            </p>
    </div>

    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')"><span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu \ne 2000 \text{ and } H_1: \mu = 2000 \)</span></button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')"><span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu = 2000 \text{ and } H_1: \mu \ne 2000 \)</span></button>
    </div>


    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden"><b>This is not correct.</b> A helpful hint is that the null hypothesis should always 
    contain an equality, as it includes the possibility that there is no difference between the population parameter <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span> 
and the hypothesized value of 2000.</p>
        <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden"><b>This is correct!</b></p>

    <h3>Practice Problem</h3>

    <i>Note:</i> Let <span class="mathjax">\(\mu_A\)</span> denote the population average salary at investment bank A and 
    <span class="mathjax">\(\mu_B\)</span> denote the population average salary at tech company B.
    </p>
		
    <p>- You have a friend who is deciding between job offers from an investment bank A 
        and a tech company B. They prefer the culture at B 
        but are concerned that A might offer higher wages. You decide to use wage data on Glassdoor to evaluate this concern by <i>
            looking for evidence that A offers higher wages than B.
        </i> What hypotheses are 
        you testing with the Glassdoor wage data?
        </p>
</div>

<div class="button-container">
    <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')"><span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu_A \le \mu_B \text{ and } H_1: \mu_A > \mu_B\)</span></button>
    <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph4')"><span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu_A \ge \mu_B \text{ and } H_1: \mu_A < \mu_B\)</span></button>
</div>

<p>
    

<p id="paragraph3" class="hidden"><b>This is correct!</b></p>
    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden"><b>This is not correct.</b> Remember, we are seeking evidence that A offers higher wages 
    than B. The alternative hypothesis is <b>always</b> the claim for which we are seeking evidence.</p>

    <p>
        <div class="button-container">
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph5')"> Click after completing practice problems </button>
        </div>
        <p id="paragraph5" class="hidden"> <b>A final word on constructing null and alternative hypotheses:</b> two helpful hints are (1) the null hypothesis always contains an equality (either <span class="mathjax">\(=\)</span>, <span class="mathjax">\(\le\)</span>, or <span class="mathjax">\(\ge\)</span>) and 
            (2) the alternative hypothesis is the claim for which we are seeking evidence (it would be bad science to fail to reject this claim just because the data doesn't convincingly suggest the opposite relationship holds). </p>
    </p>

        We will discuss these ideas in more detail in the next few conceptual pages as we review some key ideas that illustrate how to perform hypothesis tests using sample data.
