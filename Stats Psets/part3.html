    <h1>Question 1: Stating Hypotheses</h1>
    <div>
        <p> Does a change in a website's design increase conversion rates? 
            Are investment bankers paid more than software engineers?
            </p> 

            <p>

            </p>
            
            <p>When we collect sample data on the salaries of investment banking analysts
                and software engineers or the conversion rates on a website, 
                we do not observe the population parameters that we want to know about.  Instead, 
                we must use our sample data to construct estimates of population parameters like true average earnings or true average conversion rates.

        </p> 

        <p>
            The goal of any hypothesis test is to make an inference about an unknown 
            population parameter (e.g. true average earnings) using our sample data. <b>When we perform a hypothesis test</b>, the <i>alternative hypothesis</i> <span class="mathjax">\(H_1\)</span> is our new 
            theory about the world, the <i>null hypothesis</i> <span class="mathjax">\(H_0\)</span> is the old view, and we seek evidence that might allow us to reject the old view in favor of our new theory.
        </p>

            <h3>Practice Problem</h3>

            <p>
                Let <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span> denote the percentage increase in conversion rates with the new website design.
                </p>
		
        <p> Your company is performing an A/B test that offers website users two different designs: the old design and the new design. 
            They will implement the new design if it increases conversion rates by more than <span class="mathjax">\(10\%\)</span> but suspect it will not lead to a 
            <span class="mathjax">\(10\%\)</span> increase 
            You collect data from the A/B test to measure the impact of the redesign. How should you set up your hypothesis test?
            </p>
    </div>

    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')"><span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu \le 10 \text{ and } H_1: \mu > 10 \)</span></button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')"><span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu \ge 10 \text{ and } H_1: \mu < 10 \)</span></button>
    </div>


    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden"><b>This is not correct.</b> Remember, the old view is that the new design does not lead to a 
        <span class="mathjax">\(10\%\)</span> increase in the conversion rate. The alternative hypothesis should <b>always</b> represent your new theory.</p>
        <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden"><b>This is correct!</b></p>

    <h3>Practice Problem</h3>

    Let <span class="mathjax">\(\mu_I\)</span> denote the true average salary of investment bankers and 
    <span class="mathjax">\(\mu_S\)</span> denote the true average salary of software engineers.
    </p>
		
    <p> You read in a recent New York Times op-ed that investment bankers are now paid less than software engineers. You don't think this is true and decide to collect salary data to test your 
        hypothesis that investment bankers are paid more than software engineers on average. How should you set up your hypothesis test?
        </p>
</div>

<div class="button-container">
    <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')"><span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu_I \le \mu_S \text{ and } H_1: \mu_I > \mu_S\)</span></button>
    <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph4')"><span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu_I \ge \mu_S \text{ and } H_1: \mu_I < \mu_S\)</span></button>
</div>

<p>
    

<p id="paragraph3" class="hidden"><b>This is correct!</b></p>
    <p id="paragraph4" class="hidden"><b>This is not correct.</b> Remember, you are proposing that investment bankers are paid more (<i>not less</i>) than 
        software engineers. The alternative hypothesis should <b>always</b> represent your new theory.</p>
