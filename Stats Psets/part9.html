    <h1>Question 3: Regression Hypothesis Testing </h1>
    <div>
       
        <p>
            You are a financial analyst working for a hedge fund. 
            You have been given a dataset containing the daily opening and closing stock prices of Apple 
            from March 2010 - February 2020. Your task is to determine if there is a significant relationship between trading volume and daily changes in stock price.
        </p>

        <p>
            The dataset contains the following variables for each day:
            <p>
                <span class="mathjax">\(Close\)</span> - the daily closing price of Apple stock in USD
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="mathjax">\(Open\)</span> - the daily opening price of Apple stock in USD 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="mathjax">\(Volume\)</span> - the number of Apple shares traded during the trading day
            </p>

        <h3>Practice Problem</h3>


        <p> - Download the CSV on Apple stock prices from the link below. Construct a variable <span class="mathjax">\(Change = Close - Open\)</span> that is the daily change in Apple stock price.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jnhvkfyfm2jsg0bkzk6or/HistoricalQuotes.csv?rlkey=ucuzkru9u2t24dt110jji0jia&dl=0" download>Download CSV</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                1.  <a href="https://rdrr.io/snippets/">Use R</a> to estimate an OLS regression of the daily change in Apple stock price <span class="mathjax">\(Change\)</span> on trading volume <span class="mathjax">\(Volume\)</span>. This regression should contain 2518 observations, one for each day.
                Interpret the coefficient on <span class="mathjax">\(Volume\)</span>: what does it tell us?
            </p>

            <div class="button-container">
                <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">Click after completing (1)</button>
            </div>
            <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden"> Daily volatility in the Apple stock price is decreasing in trading volume. On average, Apple's stock price 
                changes by an additional 2.09 cents when trading volume falls by 10,000,000 (10 million) trades.
            </p>
    

        <p>
            2. Can we reject the null hypothesis that the true effect of trading volume on changes in stock price is zero at the 5% level? Why or why not?
        </p>

                <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">No</button>

            <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden"> <b>Great!</b> The correct null hypothesis is <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \beta_1  = 0\)</span> 
            and the correct alternative hypothesis is <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \beta_1  \ne 0\) </span>. The critical value for a two-sided
        95% hypothesis test is <span class="mathjax">\(t=\pm 1.96\)</span>, which is smaller than our value of -3.726. When the critical value is smaller than the 
        value of a test statistic, we reject the null hypothesis at the specified significance level.</p>
        
                 <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden"> <b>This isn't quite right.</b> The correct null hypothesis is <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \beta_1  = 0\)</span> 
                    and the correct alternative hypothesis is <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \beta_1  \ne 0\) </span>. Note that this is a two-sided test, as we are 
                     asked to test for a significant relationship rather than only a significant positive or significant negative relationship. The critical value for a two-sided
                95% hypothesis test is <span class="mathjax">\(t=\pm 1.96\)</span>, which is smaller  than our value of -3.726. When the critical value is smaller than the value of a test statistic, we 
            reject the null hypothesis at the specified significance level. </p>
