    <h1>Topic 9: Regression Hypothesis Testing </h1>
    <div>
       
        <p>
            You are a financial analyst working for a hedge fund. 
            You have been given a dataset containing the daily closing stock prices of a company 
            for the past year. Your task is to determine if there is a significant relationship between consumer sentiment and the company's stock prices.
        </p>

        <p>
            The dataset contains the following variables for each of the 365 days in the past year:
            <p>
                <span class="mathjax">\(P\)</span> - the daily closing price of the company's stock in USD
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="mathjax">\(CS\)</span> - an index of consumer sentiment about the firm
            </p>
            The consumer sentiment index has been normalized so <span class="mathjax">\(CS \sim N(0,1)\)</span>. Positive values represent positive sentiment.
        </p>

        <h3>Example 2</h3>


        <p> - Suppose that the true data generating process for stock prices <span class="mathjax">\(y\)</span> (in USD) is 
            <span class="mathjax">$$P = 10 + 5 CS + u$$</span> 
            where <span class="mathjax">\(u\)</span>
            is an unobserved variable that also affects stock prices.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Using R, construct a random sample of 365 daily stock prices under the assumption that <span class="mathjax">\(u \sim N(0,1)\)</span> and 
                <span class="mathjax">\(CS \sim N(0,1)\)</span>. Use the data generating process above to generate 
                <span class="mathjax">\(P\)</span> for each day.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Still using R, estimate an OLS regression of stock prices <span class="mathjax">\(P\)</span> on consumer sentiment <span class="mathjax">\(CS\)</span>. This regression should contain 365 observations, one for each day. 
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Interpret the coefficient on the consumer sentiment index: what does it tell us?
            </p>

            <div class="button-container">
                <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">Click after completing (3)</button>
            </div>
            <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden"> Because <span class="mathjax">\(CS\)</span> is normalized, 
            a one standard deviation increase in consumer sentiment leads to a <span class="mathjax">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span> dollar increase 
        in the price of the company's stock.</p>
    

        <p>
            4. Can we reject the null hypothesis that the true effect of consumer sentiment on stock prices is zero, at the 5% level? Why or why not?
        </p>
        
            <div class="button-container">
                <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">Yes</button>
                <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">No</button>
            </div>

            </p>
        
            <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden"> <b>Great!</b> The correct null hypothesis is <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \beta_1  = 0\)</span> 
            and the correct alternative hypothesis is <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \beta_1  \ne 0\) </span>. The critical value for a two-sided
        95% hypothesis test is <span class="mathjax">\(t=1.96\)</span>, which is less than our value. When the critical value is less than the 
        value of a test statistic, we reject the null hypothesis at the specified significance level.</p>
        
                 <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden"> <b>This isn't quite right.</b> The correct null hypothesis is <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \beta_1  = 0\)</span> 
                    and the correct alternative hypothesis is <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \beta_1  \ne 0\) </span>. Note that this is a two-sided test, as we are 
                     asked to test for a significant relationship rather than only a significant positive or significant negative relationship. The critical value for a two-sided
                95% hypothesis test is <span class="mathjax">\(t=1.96\)</span>, which is less than our value. When the critical value is less than the value of a test statistic, we 
            reject the null hypothesis at the specified significance level. </p>
