    <h1>Topic 4: Test Statistics</h1>
    <div>
        <p>In the previous section, we stated null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the population parameter <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span>,
            but we never observe <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span>. Instead, we use sample 
            data to construct estimates of the unknown parameter <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span>.
            </p> 

            <p>
            Since we never observe <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span>, it's not obvious how we should decide whether
            the sample data contains enough evidence in favor of <span class="mathjax">\(H_1\)</span> for us to reject <span class="mathjax">\(H_0\)</span>. 
            Test statistics provide us with a systematic way of making this decision.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most common test statistic is the t-statistic. The formula for the t-statistic for a sample average is given by 
                <span class="mathjax">$$t = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{N}} $$</span> where <span class="mathjax">\(\overline{X}\)</span> is 
                the sample average, <span class="mathjax">\(s\)</span> is the sample standard deviation, 
                <span class="mathjax">\(N\)</span> is the sample size, and <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span> is the population average 
                <b>under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true</b>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
You should be familiar with the t-statistic from course lectures. 
Because of the Central Limit Theorem, we know that the t-statistic is approximately normally distributed when <span class="mathjax">\(N>30\)</span>.
This <b>crucial</b> result allows us to use sample data generated from <i>any</i> unknown distribution to form a test statistic with a known distribution (standard normal). 
All we need are 3 basic sample statistics: the sample average, the sample standard deviation, and the sample size! 
        </p> 
        <p>
            Because we know the distribution of a standard normal random variable, 
            we are able to make statements about the probability of our sample estimate occurring if 
            the null hypothesis is true. What exactly does that mean? We can use an example to clear things up.
        </p>

            <h3>Example 3</h3>
		
        <p>- Your friend choosing between investment banking (firm A) and software engineering (firm B) goes on 
            Glassdoor and observes salary data from a subset of employees at firm A and firm B. 
            Suppose that starting salaries at firm A are 
            approximately normally distributed with mean <span class="mathjax">\(\mu = 130,000\)</span> and standard deviation  <span class="mathjax">\(\sigma = 30,000\)</span> 
            and starting salaries at firm B are approximately normally distributed with mean  <span class="mathjax">\(\mu = 120,000\)</span> and 
            standard deviation <span class="mathjax">\(\sigma = 20,000\)</span>. These will be our data generating processes.
            </p>
            <p>
            Using R, construct a random sample of 100 salaries from each of the two firms. 
            Construct the t-statistic for the difference in sample means (this is a 2 sample hypothesis test - you should modify the one-sample t-statistic formula to reflect this). 
            Now repeat this process 500 times and plot the distribution of t-statistics across all the iterations. Is the distribution approximately standard normal?
