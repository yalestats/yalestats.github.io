    <h1>Question 2: Evaluating Regression Output </h1>
    <div>
       
        <p>
            Congratulations! You have been hired as the
            Chief Data Sorcerer at "FantasyTech," a tech company that brings magical innovations to life.
        </p>

        <p>
            You are told of a dataset that contained historical 
            records of "FantasyTech" sales over the past 10 years. 
            Each of the 40 rows in the dataset represents the sales data for a particular quarter.
            You know the variables are given by
            <p>
            <span class="mathjax">\(Y\)</span> - the total number of products sold by "FantasyTech" in the given quarter
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="mathjax">\(X\)</span> - the USD amount (in thousands) spent on marketing campaigns to promote "FantasyTech" products during the quarter
            </p>
        </p>

        <p> Your goal is to recreate a regression model that predicts the future sales growth for "FantasyTech" based on the company's marketing spend. 
            Unfortunately, your predecessor seems to have misplaced this historical sales dataset and only has the following R output - which is 
            missing some information - to show you: 
            </p>
<p>
    <div class="centered-figure">
        <figure>
            <img src="figures/table.png" alt="left">
          </figure>
        </div>
</p>

<p>
   (1) To start, what is the missing value of the standard error on the coefficient for <span class="mathjax">\(X\)</span>?
</p>
        <div class="button-container">
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">Click when finished with (1) </button>
        </div>

        <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden"> You should have gotten <span class="mathjax">\(se(\hat{\beta}_1) = 2.703\)</span>. This is because 
            <span class="mathjax">$$\frac{\hat{\beta}_1}{se(\hat{\beta}_1)} = t \iff se(\hat{\beta}_1) = \frac{100.907}{37.326} $$</span> </p>

        <p>
        (2) You learn that the "FantasyTech" team has one other useful piece of information about the old regression model.
        When marketing spending was $400,000, the predicted number of products sold was 40,016.51. Using this information, what is the 
        missing value of <span class="mathjax">\(\hat{\beta}_0\)</span>, the intercept coefficient?
         </p>
                 <div class="button-container">
                     <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')">Click when finished with (2) </button>
                 </div>

        <p>

            <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden"> The predicted number of products sold <span class="mathjax">\(\hat{Y}\)</span> is given by 
                <span class="mathjax">$$\hat{Y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X $$</span>
                You are told that <span class="mathjax">\(X = 400\)</span> (be careful about the units!), so it must be that 
                <span class="mathjax">$$\hat{\beta}_0 = 40,016.51 - 100.907 \times 400  = -346.29$$</span>
            </p>

        (3) Finally, what is the missing t-statistic for the intercept <span class="mathjax">\(\beta_0\)</span>? 
        </p>

        <div class="button-container">
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph3')">Click when finished with (3) </button>
        </div>

        <p id="paragraph3" class="hidden"> You should have gotten <span class="mathjax">\(t = -0.244\)</span>. This is because 
            <span class="mathjax">$$\frac{\hat{\beta}_0}{se(\hat{\beta}_0)} = t \iff t = \frac{-346.29}{1417.973} $$</span> </p>
