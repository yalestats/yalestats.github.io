    <h1>Topic 1: Population Parameters and Sample Estimates</h1>
    <div>
        <p>We are often interested in estimating population parameters using sample data. The population parameters are features of what statisticians call a data generating process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The most commonly used population parameter is the <b>population average</b> <span class="mathjax"> \( \mu \)</span>. The population average for a roll of a fair die is the expected value of 
            a die roll <span class="mathjax">\(\mu = \frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = 3.5\)</span>. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
            Suppose we have 2 different sample of 10 rolls of a fair die: <span class="mathjax"> \( \{4, 1, 4, 2, 5, 4, 1, 3, 6, 2\} \)</span> and <span class="mathjax"> \( \{3, 5, 2, 6, 6, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5\} \)</span>. Call the first <b>sample 1</b> and the second 
            <b>sample 2</b>. What is the average roll in each sample? 

            <div class="button-container">
                <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph0')">3.5 in both sample 1 and sample 2 </button>
            </div>

            <div class="button-container">
                <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')">3.2 in sample 1 and 3.9 in sample 2</button>
            </div>

            <div class="button-container">
                <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')"> 4 in sample 1 and 3 in sample 2</button>
            </div>

            <p id="paragraph0" class="hidden"><b>Not quite!</b> This is the population average. If we denote each roll by 
                <span class="mathjax">\(x_i\)</span>, the sample average is given by 
                <span class="mathjax">$$\frac{\sum_{i} x_i}{N}$$</span>
                where <span class="mathjax">\(N\)</span> is the number of observations (rolls) in the sample. Try using this formula!
            </p>
            <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden"><b>Great!</b> You've correctly calculated the sample averages. As a reminder, if we denote each roll by 
                <span class="mathjax">\(x_i\)</span>, the sample average is given by 
                <span class="mathjax">$$\frac{\sum_{i} x_i}{N}$$</span>
                where <span class="mathjax">\(N\)</span> is the number of observations (rolls) in the sample.
                Notice that <b>neither</b> of the sample averages above is equal to the population average of 3.5. Despite this, we use sample averages like the ones above to estimate population averages when population averages are unknown. The same is true for other population parameters.
            </p>
            <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden"><b>Not quite!</b> These are the modes (most frequently occurring rolls). If we denote each roll by 
                <span class="mathjax">\(x_i\)</span>, the sample average is given by 
                <span class="mathjax">$$\frac{\sum_{i} x_i}{N}$$</span>
                where <span class="mathjax">\(N\)</span> is the number of observations (rolls) in the sample. Try using this formula!
            </p>
            </div>

            <!--You should get <span class="mathjax">\(\frac{4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 2}{10} = 3.2\)</span> and <span class="mathjax">\(\frac{3 + 5 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 5}{10} = 3.9\)</span>. -->

            </p>
            
            <h3>Practice Problem</h3>

            <p>
                Now let's switch gears to an example problem that will help illustrate the relationship between population parameters and sample estimates. <b>Note:</b> This practice problem asks you to use R to perform a simulation. For reproducibility, you should use  <span class="mathjax"> \( set.seed(123) \)</span>
                to set a value for the random seed before beginning. <b>If you are confused, try asking ChatGPT before clicking the help button.</b>

        <p> Suppose the earnings of adults in Nashville, Tennessee are approximately normally distributed with mean  <span class="mathjax"> \( \mu = 150,000 \)</span> and 
            standard deviation <span class="mathjax"> \( \sigma = 30,000 \)</span>.  <a href="https://rdrr.io/snippets/">Use R</a> to construct 4 different random samples of <span class="mathjax"> \( 7 \)</span> individuals from this population.
            You can think of these samples as 4 annual observations of each person's earnings. Answer the following questions:
        </p>

        <p>
            1. What are the population parameters in this example?
        </p>
        <p>
            2. What are the sample averages for each individual?
