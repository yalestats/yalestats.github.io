    <h1>Question 2: Hypothesis Testing</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The last (and perhaps most important) component of 
            hypothesis testing is the actual test itself. This can take one of two forms, with the first being the most common:
            </p> 

            <p>
            <i>1. Comparing the p-value <span class="mathjax">\(p\)</span> to the significance level. We commonly use <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha\)</span> to represent the significance level.</i>
            <p>
                a. If <span class="mathjax">\(p < \alpha\)</span>, you reject the null hypothesis.
            </p>
            <p>
                b. If <span class="mathjax">\(p > \alpha\)</span>, you fail to reject the null hypothesis because of insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
            </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>2. Comparing the test statistic <span class="mathjax">\(t\)</span> to a critical value <span class="mathjax">\(t_{crit}\)</span>. </i>
                <p>
                    a. If <span class="mathjax">\(|t| > |t_{crit}|\)</span>, you reject the null hypothesis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    b. If <span class="mathjax">\(|t| < |t_{crit}|\)</span>, you fail to reject the null hypothesis because of insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
                </p>
            
            <p>
                Before going on to an application, let's define the <b>significance level</b> and <b>critical value</b>.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The <b>significance level</b> of a hypothesis test is a value chosen by you, the analyst, before performing any data analysis. 
            The most common are <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha = 0.01, 0.05, \text{ and } 0.1\)</span>. The significance level is the maximum 
            probability you allow for committing a Type I error, which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. 
            This case is highlighted in red in the table below.
            <div class="centered-figure">
                <figure>
                    <img src="figures/type1.png" alt="crit_image">
                    <figcaption><b>Figure:</b> <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha = 0.1\)</span> and 
                        <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> critical values</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                </div>
            <p>If you choose a significance level of <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>, 
                it means you are willing to accept a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (a 5% chance of a Type I error). </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>critical value</b> is the value of the test statistic used in hypothesis testing to determine whether you should 
            reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. It depends on the chosen significance level <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha\)</span>. 
            A smaller <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha\)</span> will result in a larger critical value. This is shown below for a one-sided hypothesis 
            with <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha = 0.1\)</span> and <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>. 
            The <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha\)</span> values are the shaded regions to the right of the critical values.
            
            <div class="centered-figure">
            <figure>
                <img src="figures/critical_value.png" alt="crit_image">
                <figcaption><b>Figure:</b> <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha = 0.1\)</span> and 
                    <span class="mathjax">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> critical values</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, you can find the critical values using R or other statistical software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that we have all the pieces in order, we can work through a full hypothesis test. 
        </p>

            <h3>Practice Problem</h3>
		
        <p>- You are hired as a consultant for a firm that wants to know if software 
            developers who work from home (group 1) are not as productive as software developers 
            who come into the office (group 2). They ask you to perform a statistical test at the 5% significance 
            level to verify whether this is the case. To perform the analysis, you are given the following data on software 
            developer productivity for these two groups, where productivity is measured as the number of code commits per day. You are 
            looking for <i>evidence that software developers who work from home are <b>less</b> productive than those that come into the office</i>.
            </p>

            <div class="centered-figure">
                <figure>
                    <img src="figures/data.png" alt="data">
                  </figure>
                </div>

            <p>
            i. Let <span class="mathjax">\(\mu_1\)</span> denote the population 
            average productivity of software developers in group 1 and <span class="mathjax">\(\mu_2\)</span> denote the population 
            average productivity of software developers in group 2. <b>What are the correct null and alternative hypotheses?</b>
            </p>
    </div>


<div class="button-container">
    <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')"> <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu_1 < \mu_2 \text{ and } H_1: \mu_1 \ge \mu_2 \)</span> </button>
    <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')"> <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu_1 \ge \mu_2 \text{ and } H_1: \mu_1 < \mu_2 \)</span> </button>
    <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')"> <span class="mathjax">\(H_0: \mu_1 \le \mu_2 \text{ and } H_1: \mu_1 > \mu_2 \)</span> </button>
</div>

<p id="paragraph1" class="hidden"> <b>This is answer is not correct.</b> You may have forgotten that the null hypothesis always 
    contains an equality. The equality in the null hypothesis is important to remember because it 
    reflects the assumption that any observed differences in sample averages are only because of random chance.</p>
<p id="paragraph2" class="hidden"> <b>Correct!</b></p>
<p id="paragraph2" class="hidden"> <b>This is answer is not correct.</b> You may have forgotten that the alternative hypothesis is the claim for 
    which you are seeking evidence. You are looking for evidence that developers who work from home (group 1) are less productive.</p>
    
<p>
    ii. What is the value of the test statistic?
    </p>
</div>


<div class="button-container">
<button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph11')"> <span class="mathjax">\(t = -1.941\)</span> </button>
<button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph21')"> <span class="mathjax">\(t = 1.941\)</span> </button>
<button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph21')"> <span class="mathjax">\(t = 1.643\)</span> </button>
</div>

<p id="paragraph11" class="hidden"> <b>Correct!</b> </p>
<p id="paragraph21" class="hidden"> <b>This is answer is not correct.</b> Remember that 
    <span class="mathjax">$$t = \frac{(\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2)-(\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{SE}$$</span> The first term in the numerator is -0.4. The 
    second term in the numerator is 0 because the population averages are equal under the null hypothesis. The denominator is the SE and is equal to 0.206. Remember this
    is a two sample case!
</p>
<p id="paragraph31" class="hidden"> <b>This is answer is not correct.</b> Remember that 
    <span class="mathjax">$$t = \frac{(\overline{X}_1 - \overline{X}_2)-(\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{SE}$$</span>. The first term in the numerator is -0.4. The 
    second term in the numerator is 0 because the population averages are equal under the null hypothesis. The denominator is the SE and is equal to 0.206. Remember this
    is a two sample case!</p>

<p>
    ii. Will the null hypothesis be rejected at the 5% significance level? What is the correct interpretation?
    </p>
</div>


<div class="button-container">
<button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph12')">Yes</button>
<button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph22')">No</button>
</div>


<p id="paragraph12" class="hidden"> <b>Correct!</b> You should have found
     that <span class="mathjax">$$t = -1.941 < -1.64 = \Phi(0.05)$$</span> So software developers who work from home are less
      productive, on average, than software developers who come into the office. </p>
<p id="paragraph22" class="hidden"> <b>This answer is not correct.</b> If you found that 
    <span class="mathjax">$$t = -1.941 > -1.96 = \Phi(0.025)$$</span> you may have forgotten that the common critical 
    value of 1.96 for a 5% hypothesis test is for a two-sided hypothesis test only.</p>
