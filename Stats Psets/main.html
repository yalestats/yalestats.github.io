    <h1>Introduction: Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            This module will work through the concepts of Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing. Before we start talking about confidence intervals directly, it's important to review how statisticians
            think about the data that we collect to perform statistical analyses. Statisticians take the view that any observed outcome (e.g. today's temperature) is a realization from an underlying "true" model of the world. Each day 
            the temperature is produced from a complex, uncertain system, and statisticians make specific assumptions to learn about the features of this "true" model using observed temperature data.
        </p>

    <p>
        To use a simpler example, we know the roll of a fair die can take on any of the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 with probability = 1/6. This distribution of probabilities 
        across outcomes is the "true" model or <b>data generating process</b> for rolling a fair die. 
        Each time we roll a die, we observe a single outcome that we call a <b>realization</b>. This realization could be a 1, a 3, or any other of the 6 possible values.
        A set of realizations that we collect is called a <b>sample</b> and could look like {4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 4, 1, 3, 6, 2}, {3, 5, 2, 6, 6, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5}, or any other possible combination of rolls.</p>
    </p> 

    <p>
        In the next section, we'll learn more about how statisticians use observed sample data to learn about the features of "true" models. If you already feel comfortable with this idea and the concept of 
        confidence intervals more generally, feel free to skip ahead to the section on hypothesis testing. Some extra online resources are included at the bottom of the page.
