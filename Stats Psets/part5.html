    <h1>Topic 5: The p-value</h1>
    <div>
        <p>In the previous section, we used the Central Limit Theorem to show that the t-statistic is approximately normal distributed when 
            <span class="mathjax">\(N>30\)</span>. Now we'll use this fact to construct p-values, an important building block of hypothesis testing.
            So what is the p-value?
            </p>
            <p><b>A p-value is the probability of obtaining a 
                test statistic at least as extreme as the one you calculated under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.</b> </p> 
            <p>
                We use the t-statistic to construct the p-value. How? Suppose you calculate the t-statistic for some sample average. You call 
                this t-statistic <span class="mathjax">\(\hat{t}\)</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                a. The p-value for a one-sided right tail test is given by 
                <div class="centered-figure">

                b. The p-value for a one-sided left tail test is given by
                <div class="centered-figure">

                    </div>
                
            </p>

            <p>
                c. The p-value for a two-tail test is given by
                <div class="centered-figure">
                    <figure>
                        <img src="figures/two_sided.png" alt="two_sided">
                        <figcaption><b>Figure:</b> two-tail hypothesis test </figcaption>
                      </figure>
                    </div>
                
            </p>

            <p>
                Because the t-statistic is approximately normally distributed, we know that
                <span class="mathjax">$$\Pr(t \le \hat{t}) = \Phi(\hat{t})$$</span> where <span class="mathjax">\(\Phi(\cdot)\)</span>
                is the standard normal CDF. In practice, you will use R or other statistical software to calculate <span class="mathjax">\(\Phi(\hat{t})\)</span> 
                and find p-values.

            </p>

            <p>
            One last tip. If the use of a conditional probability is a little confusing in the equations above, it may be helpful to recall the formula for a t-statistic. The formula is given by
            <span class="mathjax">$$\hat{t} = \frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{N}}$$</span>
            Notice that <span class="mathjax">\(\overline{X}\)</span>, <span class="mathjax">\(s\)</span>, and 
            <span class="mathjax">\(N\)</span> are all features of the sample data. So what is <span class="mathjax">\(\mu\)</span>? It
            is the true mean under the assumption that the null hypothesis <span class="mathjax">\(H_0\)</span> is true. In fact, we <b>cannot</b> calculate a test statistic and perform a hypothesis test 
            unless the null hypothesis is assumed to be true. 
        </p>

            <h3>Example 4</h3>
		
        <p>- To illustrate this ideas, let's return to your friend choosing between investment banking (firm A) and software engineering (firm B). Remember that starting salaries at firm A 
            are approximately normally distributed with mean <span class="mathjax">\(\mu = 130,000\)</span> and standard deviation  <span class="mathjax">\(\sigma = 30,000\)</span> 
            and starting salaries at firm B are approximately normally distributed with mean  <span class="mathjax">\(\mu = 120,000\)</span> and 
            standard deviation <span class="mathjax">\(\sigma = 20,000\)</span>. As before, these will be our data generating processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Using R, construct a random sample of 100 salaries from each of the two firms (200 total salaries). 
                This represents the data your friend observes on Glassdoor. 
                Calculate the test statistic and p-value for the difference in mean salaries between the two firms. 
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Now take this dataset of 200 salaries and randomly divide it into 2 groups of 100. 
                Calculate the test statistic for the difference in mean salaries between these two groups of 100. 
                Repeat this process 500 times. 
                What does this accomplish? You are simulating test statistics for the case when the 
                difference in average salaries in the two firm samples is only due to chance. Equivalently, 
                these simulated test statistics are calculated under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. 
            </p>
            <p>
            3. Finally, calculate the share of iterations (i.e. <span class="mathjax">\(\frac{\#}{500}\)</span> ) where the value of the test statistic 
            is greater than the test statistic in the original dataset of 200 salaries. 
            This proportion is a simulated p-value. Compare this result with the p-value from the original sample. Are they approximately the same?

    </p>

<p id="paragraph5" class="hidden"> The simulated p-value and sample p-value should be about the same. The reason is that the simulated p-value is the 
    empirical probability of observing an outcome at least as extreme as the one you got in the original sample conditional 
     on the null hypothesis being true. That's just the empirical counterpart to the definition of a p-value! </p>
