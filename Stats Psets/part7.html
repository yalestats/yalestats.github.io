    <h1>Question 1: Introduction to Regression </h1>
    <div>
       
        <p>
            Suppose the <b>data generating process</b> for salaries <span class="mathjax">\(Sal\)</span> at a specific firm is given by
            <span class="mathjax">$$Sal = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Exp  + u$$</span> 
            where <span class="mathjax">\(Exp\)</span> is the years of experience for a particular employee and <span class="mathjax">\(u\)</span>
            is a random variable that also affects employee salary.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i><b>Central question:</b></i> given data on <span class="mathjax">\(Exp\)</span> and <span class="mathjax">\(Sal\)</span>, how can we 
            estimate <span class="mathjax">\(\beta_0 \)</span> and <span class="mathjax">\(\beta_1 \)</span>?
        </p> 
        <p>If we are willing to assume that (1) <span class="mathjax">\(E[u|Exp] = E[u]\)</span> and (2) <span class="mathjax">\(E[u] = 0\)</span>, we 
            can use OLS! The first assumption (1) is known as <b>conditional independence</b> and implies that any other variables that affect salary (e.g. ability) 
           for employees of the firm aren't 
            systematically related to the years of experience that worker has at the firm. 
            </p>
            <p>The second assumption (2) 
            is just a normalization.
        </p>

<h3>Practice Problem</h3>

<p>- A small manufacturing firm with 30 employees is reviewing its wage structure and asks you to evaluate how worker salaries change with experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        1.  <a href="https://rdrr.io/snippets/">Use R</a> to estimate an OLS regression of salary <span class="mathjax">\(Sal\)</span> on years of experience <span class="mathjax">\(Exp\)</span>. This regression should contain 30 observations, one for each employee. 
        What is the estimated coefficient on years of experience <span class="mathjax">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span>?
    </p>

    <div class="button-container">
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph1')"><span class="mathjax">\(\hat{\beta}_1 = 9450\)</span></button>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph2')"><span class="mathjax">\(\hat{\beta}_1 = 0.0001013\)</span></button>
    </div>
    

    <p id="paragraph1" class="hidden"> <b>Great!</b> This is correct. </p>

         <p id="paragraph2" class="hidden"> <b>This isn't quite right.</b> The <i>lm()</i> command in R has the syntax <i>lm(y ~ x)</i>. </p>

         <p>
            2. How much of the variation in salaries can be explained by variation in years of experience?
        </p>

        <div class="button-container">
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph_a')"><span class="mathjax">\(59.9\% \)</span></button>
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph_b')"><span class="mathjax">\(95.5\% \)</span></button>
        </div>
        
        <p id="paragraph_a" class="hidden"> <b>This isn't quite right.</b> You should be looking for the model's adjusted <span class="mathjax">\(R^2 \)</span> </i>. </p>

        <p id="paragraph_b" class="hidden"> <b>Great!</b> This is correct. </p>
    
             
        <p>
            3. According to the model, what is the expected salary of someone with 4 years of experience at the firm?
        </p>

        <div class="button-container">
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph_c')"><span class="mathjax">\( $60,150\)</span></button>
            <button onclick="toggleVisibility('paragraph_d')"><span class="mathjax">\($63,592 \)</span></button>
        </div>
        
        <p id="paragraph_c" class="hidden"> <b>This isn't quite right.</b> You should use the model estimates, not the data, to construct this. </p>

        <p id="paragraph_d" class="hidden"> <b>Great!</b> This is correct. </p>
